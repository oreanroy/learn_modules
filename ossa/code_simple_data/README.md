### Things to keep in mind while writing tests
	code coverage make sure the number of tests cover all portions of the code, if all portion
	are not covered you need more test

### HTDF Things to keep in mind while designing data
	When you design programs the style of programming that you will follow further and the
	approach will highly depend on the way you interpret data. 
	So what is data is the presentaion of real life information in progrmatic pradrigms
	and how you will represent it in program. Like int 30 can mean speed of a car age 
	of a person to make this difference you need data defination that is how you are
	converting infomation into data. 
	Now the way you classify data that is how you assume to the inherit structure of
	information will highly affect the further program. The information can be atomic 
	ditinct(speed), atomic non distict(like blue, red, or green), iterative(1 to 10),
	enumeration(red, green, blue), itemization(that is the data is divided into parts 
	and each part has its own characterictic and may have further divison)

	So once you select the data defination for an information it is gonna highly affect
	the way your program moves further.

	So there is this tempalte defined by the prof to create a data from the info. So the
	template is something like this

	The first step of the recipe is to identify the inherent structure of the information
	once that is done now there are these steps
	  1  A possible structure defination(fo rcompound data)
	  2  A type comment that dfines a new type name and decribes how to form data of that 
	     type
	  3 An interpration that describes correspondence between information and data
	  4 One or more examples of the data
	  5 A template for a 1 argument function operating on data of this type.
